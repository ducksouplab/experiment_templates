  Welcome! This experiment is organized by Evelina Hagstr√∂m from Lund University as part of a master's thesis, 
  alongside supervisors Daniel Zander, Petter Johansson and Pablo Arias (Univseristy of Glasgow). 

  
  The experiments lasts about 30 minutes. It aims to investigate human social interaction and first impressions.



  You will participate in several voice call interactions, with one other person at the time. 
  The conversations will be limited to 90 seconds, and during the conversations we would like you to speak freely with your conversation partner
  with the goal of finding out if you and the others person could become friends, in theory. We know that this is a very short interaction
  which might make it difficult to judge these things, but we ask that you rely on intuition.
  After each interaction, you will be asked questions about the conversations and your first impression of the other person. All your answers are anonymous. 



  Furthermore, we would like to record the audio interactions. 
  These recordings will remain completely confidential and will only be used for scientific purposes. 
  

  Your participation in the study is completely voluntary, and you have the option to withdraw from the study at any time.
