  Welcome! This experiment lasts about 30 minutes and aims to investigate human social interaction and first impressions.
  <!-- is organized by Evelina HagstrÃ¶m from Lund University as part of a master's thesis, 
  alongside supervisors Daniel Zander, Petter Johansson and Pablo Arias (Univseristy of Glasgow).  -->  
  <br /><br />
  You will participate in several <strong>voice call</strong> interactions, with one other person at the time. 
  The conversations will be limited to <strong>90 seconds</strong>, and during the conversations we would like you to speak <strong>freely</strong> with your conversation partner
  with the goal of simply trying to get a sense of the other person. 
  
  <br /><br />
  
  After each interaction, you will be asked a randomized set of questions about the conversation and your <strong>first impression</strong> of the other person. All your answers are anonymous.
  One of these questions will ask whether you think you could become friends with this person, <strong>in theory</strong>. We understand that 90 seconds is a short time, but do you your best to give 
  thoughtful responsens and feel free to trust your intuition when responding. 
  Every participant will be asked a unique set of questions and it is <strong>very important</strong> that you <strong>do not</strong> discuss these questions with any of your conversation partners.
