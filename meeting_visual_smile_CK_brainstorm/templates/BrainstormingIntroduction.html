  <h3>What is Brainstorming?</h3>

  <p>
    In this study, you will take part in short idea-generation sessions with other participants.
    These are called <strong>brainstorming sessions</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Brainstorming means coming up with as many ideas as you can in a short time. The goal is to be <strong>creative, spontaneous, and open-minded</strong>.
    There are no wrong answers â€” even unusual or surprising ideas are welcome.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are investigating how people think and interact during creative tasks. So please participate actively,
    and try to contribute <strong>as many different and original ideas as you can</strong> during each session.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you're ready, click <strong>Next</strong> to begin.
