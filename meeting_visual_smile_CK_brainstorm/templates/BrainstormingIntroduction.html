  <h3>What is Brainstorming?</h3>

  <p>
    In this study, we are investigating how people think and interact during creative tasks. To do this, you will take part in short idea-generation sessions with other participants, called <strong>brainstorming sessions</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Brainstorming means to come up with as many ideas as you can in a short amount of time. The goal of the experiment is therefore to be <strong>creative, spontaneous, and open-minded</strong>. There are no wrong answers â€” even unusual or surprising ideas are welcome.
  </p>

  <p>
    With this in mind, please participate actively, and try to contribute with <strong>as many different and original ideas as you can</strong> during each session.
  </p>

    When you're ready, click <strong>Next</strong> to begin.
