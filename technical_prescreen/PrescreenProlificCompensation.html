            <h3>Important Information</h3>

            <p><strong>The main experiment is a live interaction experiment</strong> where multiple participants must join at the <strong>exact same time</strong>.
            The success of the experiment depends on everyone being present at the scheduled time. It is crucial that you are logged in and ready 10 minutes before your scheduled time. Please enable an alarm on your phone to remember your timeslot <span style = "color:red"><strong>{{selected_day}} {{selected_time}} {{am_pm}}</strong>.</span> Moreover, it is crucial that you use exactly the same set-up for the full experiment as used during this pre-sceening session. Namely: use the same computer, internet browser, internet connection and audio settings.


            <p>We will send you a direct message 10 minutes before the experiment to notify you that it is live. If you can't see our study in your dashboard please notify us and we will send a direct link to the experiment.</p>
