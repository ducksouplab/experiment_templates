  <p>The aim of this pre-screening is to test your communication setup to ensure high-quality audio for the main experiment. We'll assess both your microphone quality and headphone functionality.
    You will need to complete the same audio test again at the beginning of the main experiment.
    However, unlike in this pre-screening where you only have one attempt, during the main experiment you will have multiple opportunities to adjust your setup if needed. 
  </p>
  
  <h3>Important Information</h3>
  
  <ol>
    <li>After passing the audio test, you'll be asked to confirm whether you're available for the full experiment during the available time slot(s).</li>
    <li>Once you confirm your availability, you'll be redirected to the Prolific homepage and receive a completion code.</li>
    <li>We'll send a friendly reminder before your scheduled session.</strong></li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>If you do not pass the audio test, you'll be directly redirected to the Prolific homepage and still receive a completion code.</p>
  
  <p>More detailed task instructions for the pre-screening will be provided after you've configured your audio setup. Press "Next" to proceed to the audio configuration page.</p>
