 <p>
  This study investigates how different forms of verbal reflection may influence memory and interpretation of images.
</p>

<p> Please read the following instructions <strong>carefully: </strong></p> 

  <p>
    The study consists of three rounds. In each round, you will:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li> View a randomly selected image during 15 seconds from a stockpile of over 400 images .</li>
    <li> You’ll be asked to briefly report how the image made you feel using a simple mood slider.</li>
    <li> You will be randomly assigned one of two conditions where you will complete a verbal reflection task. You will either: </li>
      <ul>
      <li> <strong>reflect verbally (alone)</strong> while seeing yourself on screen (mirror-like condition), or</li>
    <li> <strong>reflect verbally (Interactively) </strong> while seeing another person on screen (interactive condition)</li>
      </ul>
    <li> You will then rate your feelings again, just as before.</li>
    <li> Answer memory questions regarding the image you saw earlier in the round. </li>
  </ol>


  <p>
    Your memory responses will be <strong>evaluated and scored. </strong> 
    Try to answer as accurately as possible — this helps ensure data quality across the study.
  </p>
 <p>
    The emotion slider is included as a standard part of the process,  
    there are no right or wrong responses.
  </p>
  
    

<p>
    The video feed during reflection is recorded solely for research purposes related to analyzing verbal responses.  
    All recordings are stored securely, used only within the project, and never linked to any identifying information.  
    Your data is handled anonymously and in full accordance with ethical research guidelines.
  </p>
  <p>
  If you are assigned the solo reflection task, we ask that you <strong>look</strong> at the video feed and <strong>speak</strong> as if interacting with another person.  
</p>
<p>   Please remember to follow the <strong>technical instructions</strong> from the previous page.
</p>
  </p>

      <p>Press <strong>'Next'</strong> when you are ready to start the experiment. </p>
