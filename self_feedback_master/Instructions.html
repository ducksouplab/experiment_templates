 <p>
  This study investigates how different forms of verbal reflection may influence memory and interpretation of images.
</p>

<p> Please read the following instructions carefully:</p> 

  <p>
    The study consists of three rounds. In each round, you will:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li> View a randomly selected image from a stockpile of over 400 images.</li>
    <li> Rate your mood using a visual slider.</li>
    <li> You may or may not be assigned to complete a verbal reflection task.</li>
    <li> Rate your mood again using the same slider.</li>
    <li> Answer memory questions regarding the image you saw earlier in the round. </li>
  </ol>


  <p>
    Your memory responses will be evaluated and scored.  
    Try to answer as accurately as possible — this helps ensure data quality across the study.
  </p>
 <p>
    The emotion slider is included as a standard part of the process to help us track general patterns.  
    There are no right or wrong responses.
  </p>

  <p>
    The verbal reflection format will be randomized. In each round, you will either:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li> Reflect verbally (alone) while seeing yourself on screen (mirror-like condition)</li>
    <li> Reflect verbally (Interactively) while seeing another person on screen (interactive condition)</li>
    <li> Have no reflection time provided </li>
  </ul>

<p>
    The video feed during reflection is recorded solely for research purposes related to analyzing verbal responses.  
    All recordings are stored securely, used only within the project, and never linked to any identifying information.  
    Your data is handled anonymously and in full accordance with ethical research guidelines.
  </p>
  <p>
  If you are assigned the reflection task, we ask that you keep your eyes on the video feed — whether you're seeing yourself or another person.  
  This helps ensure a consistent reflection environment across participants and supports the memory-related aspects of the study.
</p>
  </p>

      <p>Press 'Next' when you are ready to start the first round of the experiment. </p>
